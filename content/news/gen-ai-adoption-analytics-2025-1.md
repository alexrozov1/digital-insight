Generative AI is scaling fast in 2025—spending is forecasted by Gartner to reach $644 B, up 76% YoY, while ROI lands at 3.7× for every dollar invested. However, challenges persist: 45% of organizations cite lack of skilled teams, and 75% of consumers worry about AI-related security risks—underlining barriers to adopting toolsets like data-driven targeting or personalization pipelines. Still, early adopters are gaining traction in web and app analytics, using AI to enhance campaign attribution and improve user experiences.
