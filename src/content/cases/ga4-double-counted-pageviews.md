## Symptoms
- Pageviews ~1.6x baseline after SPA migration.
- DebugView shows duplicate `page_view` on route change.

## Checks
1. GTM preview: multiple tags firing on `historyChange` and on a custom event.
2. Router: both `pushState` listener and route hook send events.

## Fix
- Emit exactly **one** `page_view` per route.
- Debounce history changes; dedupe if same path within 500ms.

## Validate
- Compare 7â€‘day pre/post; <5% drift accepted.
- Segment by route group to detect regressions.
